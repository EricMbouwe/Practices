# 1- Review Past review

Hi @HillaryOkello ,

Good job so far! You really show strong skills on Github features by using inline comments and providing a summary review.
There are some issues that you still need to work on to go to the next project especially your communication but you are almost there

## Required Changes ♻️

_Check the comments under the review._

## Optional suggestions

_Every comment with the [OPTIONAL] prefix is not crucial enough to stop the approval of this PR. However, I strongly recommend you to take them into account as they can make your code better._

You can also consider:

- [OPTIONAL] Follow the code review template provided and add all the links inside of it.

Cheers and Happy coding!👏👏👏

Feel free to leave any questions or comments in the PR thread if something is not 100% clear.

**_Please, do not open a new Pull Request for re-reviews. You should use the same Pull Request submitted for the first review, either valid or invalid unless it is requested otherwise._**

_As described in the [Code reviews limits policy](https://microverse.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500004088561) you have a limited number of reviews per project (check the exact number in your Dashboard). If you think that the code review was not fair, you can request a second opinion using [this form](https://airtable.com/shrQAqnBwek5a0O0s)._

# 2- Contact-form First review

Hi @ignatius22,

While you made a great effort in this project, unfortunately, I cannot proceed to review your code.

## Invalid Code Review Request

You have submitted a project, that does not have a custom Readme with the project's documentation. Always think about people that you share your code with: collaborators, code reviewers, programmers who might want to reuse and/or improve your code.
You should make sure that your repo looks professional before review. Please take a step back and read a lesson [here](https://microverse.pathwright.com/library/fast-track-curriculum/69047/path/step/66243642/).

Your Code Review Request will be marked as invalid in your Dashboard, so please submit a new one once you are ready 🙏

Cheers and Happy coding!👏👏👏

_Invalid Code Review Request **does not count** into the code reviews limit._

# 3- Contact-form Second review

Hi @HillaryOkello,

# Status: Approved✔️

Your project is complete! There is nothing else to say other than... it's time to merge it 💪
Congratulations! 🎉

## Optional suggestions

_Check the comments under the review._

_Every comment with the [OPTIONAL] prefix won't stop the approval of this PR. However, I strongly recommend you to take them into account as they can make your code better. Some of them were simply missed by the previous reviewer and addressing them will really improve your application._
